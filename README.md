<b>Bubble Game Using Javascriptâ€‹:</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>I created a bubble game using JavaScript where players have one minute to pop bubbles displaying random numbers. The game challenges players by providing a target number that they need to pop within the time limit. 
<br>
<br>
  Each correctly popped bubble adds 10 points to the score, while popping a bubble with the wrong number subtracts 10 points. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible before the timer runs out.
 <br>
 <br>
  This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by implementing real-time score tracking, random number generation, and a countdown timer.
<br>
<br>
   It also enhanced my skills in DOM manipulation and event handling, as the game requires dynamic updates to the UI based on user interactions. Creating this game was both a fun and educational experience, showcasing my ability to build interactive web applications from scratch.
